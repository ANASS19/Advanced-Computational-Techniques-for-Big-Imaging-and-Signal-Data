for the project file.ipynb:
name of it exam-project
    to work he can be run in kaggle or google colab.
    it will better if it's run in kaggle.
    I use kaggle beciase give more ressources and he does'n get blocked and crashed like colab.
I created 2 dashboardes one i use thefirst model that I used a simple deep neural network:
to run it 
The first dashboard works With simple neural network Model "streamlit run dashboard.py"
The second dashboard works with CNN model "streamlit run dashcnn.py"
ProccesingData.py ile to procces test to work ni dashboard.
after i remouve target lables from test set and do some preprocceing i created this dataset datainput.cv is the data sets i use to test the dahsbord

to run the dashboard: use this command streamlit run dashboard.py

I remouve the test set and train set from this file to make the file not heavy.
